# Currently in the UI, each Persona only has one prompt, which is why there are 3 very similar personas defined below.

personas:
  # This id field can be left blank for other default personas, however an id 0 persona must exist
  # this is for DanswerBot to use when tagged in a non-configured channel
  # Careful setting specific IDs, this won't autoincrement the next ID value for postgres

    # Default Document Sets for this persona, specified as a list of names here.

    # The admin can then use the UI to add new connectors to the document set

    # document_sets:
    #   - "HR Resources"
    #   - "Engineer Onboarding"
    #   - "Benefits"
